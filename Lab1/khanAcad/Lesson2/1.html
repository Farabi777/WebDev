        <p> <strong> It is a social species </strong>, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear <em> sounds </em>  too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. </p>
